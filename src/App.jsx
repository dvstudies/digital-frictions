                                We land in new geographies, we immerse ourselves
                                in vaguely intuited contexts, to cross, gently
                                and wildly, the blurred mists of clich√©, of
                                assumptions and commonplaces, and to enter into
                                the unmitigated richness of a palimpsest. How to
                                inhabit this natural, cultural, social and
                                emotional maelstrom? Our digital age, with
                                networked and scaled images, with distributed,
                                automated and supposedly intelligent
                                computational processes, exacerbates the
                                processes of syncretism that characterise every
                                culture. The large artificial intelligence
                                models that increasingly mediate and shape
                                contemporary culture are trained on vast amounts
                                of unfiltered data from the internet, mostly
                                representative of a global north, Anglo-Saxon
                                based culture. What to do with our cultural
                                legacies and heritages that are foreign to this
                                reality? How to preserve and promote them? Do we
                                accept to be swallowed up and processed by the
                                machine to be part of this new automated and
                                merciless syncretism? Or do we say we inhabit
                                the shadows of silence, of invisibility as a
                                strategy for survival?
